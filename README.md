SMART DOOR SYSTEM USING IOT

This smart door system is specifically designed for Classroom purpose.
Consider a scenario where a teacher / professor enter into classroom. Firstly, teacher needs to 
unlock the door so that everyone can enter the classroom and CR will notify every student about the 
particular class taking place than slowly students reach the classroom and sometimes they got late 
and disturb the class including teacher.

 Imagine a smart door system which will open "Automatically" when the professor scans a 
particular identity being allotted.

Not only that, after opening the classroom door a message will be sent by system to all the 
students for that class and of which subject as It’s all in the identity allotted.

 Also after 10 min of opening the gate any person who want to enter shall not be permitted 
and the door will get locked automatically after the timer completed.

Our work not only stop there the system of after opening the gate will count the number of 
students who are entering in the class. This counting of students holds a lot of importance.

Now for scenario of student having any health issues due to any reason or condition. Many students
have health problems and to counter that situation to avoid that viral to infect others, we’ll have a
temperature sensor which check and compare it with the normal temperature if found the 
temperature is above normal level than an alarm will be played.

Now when the class is finished then again the professor needs to scan the identity given to open the 
door and only when all student will leave the class the door will close itself.

For any emergency by considering the whole scenario, if by chance the situation arises when the ID 
of professor not working or anything unexpected happens at that time the emergency button can be 
pressed to open the door forcefully at that time.

But after pushing that button a notification of emergency will be sent to higher authority.
So, this smart door system will not only change the primitive way in which classrooms were being 
carried out but also prevent any wrong activity and any sort of misconducts that used to take place. 
The Smart door will enhance the overall experience of teaching and learning.
